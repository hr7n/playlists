[![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

## Top 5 is your go-to tool for effortlessly curating delightful 5-song playlists, perfect for sparking engaging conversations with your friends!

Our motivation for creating Top5 was to help our user create short, easy playlists that they can listen to quickly and chat about with their friends! 
We learned the exponential complexity of working with this type of data and appreciate the effort that goes into similar applications.
We plan to further develop more features in the future to make longer playlists, add playlists to your Spotify account, and many more dynamic features

## Usage/Tests

Navigating our interface is simple, in order to create a new playlist, click the "Make Playlist" button, or click the same link in the navigation bar.

You can also click on the Daily Featured Playlist to open a chat to talk with your friends about the featured playlist!
The process should look something like this:
